## üç≥ What's in da Fridge?

**What's in da Fridge?** is a playful Farcaster Mini App designed to turn your leftover ingredients into quick, fun recipe suggestions. It features a cartoon-style fridge that you can interact with: open the fridge door, view your ingredients, and get cooking ideas based on what you have.

The app offers a demo mode for users who haven't connected their wallet yet, and unlocks persistent personal fridges when a wallet is connected. Ingredients are categorized and displayed inside a beautifully animated fridge UI, with sounds and micro-interactions that make the experience feel alive.

It's perfect for:
- Degens who love to cook (or at least pretend to).
- Users looking for a fun, onchain-native way to manage ingredients.
- Anyone exploring how creative Farcaster Frames can be.

### üîÆ Upcoming Features

- **OpenAI-powered recipe generation**: Instead of only predefined recipes, the app will use OpenAI to suggest new meals based on whatever weird (or normal) combination of ingredients you add. AI chef incoming. üë®‚Äçüç≥
  
- **Redis-based notification system**: With Redis and webhook integration, connected users will receive onchain-native notifications when new recipes, features, or personalized content becomes available. This enables a smarter, more interactive experience.

- **Ingredient memory per wallet**: Users will soon be able to permanently store and retrieve their fridge contents via wallet-based storage (e.g., via Frames, or custom backend).

- **Social recipe sharing**: Share your fridge or your best recipe combo directly on Farcaster. Let others cook your degenerate creations.

Built using:
- [MiniKit](https://docs.base.org/builderkits/minikit/overview) for seamless Farcaster integration
- [OnchainKit](https://docs.base.org/builderkits/onchainkit/getting-started) for metadata and account association
- [Base](https://base.org) for onchain logic
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for blazing fast deployment

üåà This is just the beginning ‚Äî more degen kitchen experiments coming soon!
